Bus Tracker Exercise

This is an exercise I did for my MIT MERN stack bootcamp. A marker is animated to move from bus stop to bus stop from the MIT campus to the Harvard campus using the mapbox API.

How to Run:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio code.

2. Right click index.html

3. Select "Copy Path"

4. Open browser and paste into URL

Roadmap of future improvements:

It would be nice if you could click the button again to restart the animation. Also, the button to start the animation is huge. Maybe make it smaller. Perhaps mark the beginning and end of the route as well as the bus stops on the way.
